## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

  My app uses two external api's and combines them together so that users can utilize both of
  them simultaniously. The app uses the dog and the cat API's, and calls images of cats and
  dogs from within them. The app opens up wit images of both cats and dogs, but there is a search bar,
  and you can search for pictures of either cats or dogs. If you do not enter a cat or dog properly,
  the app will you give you an error message. This app allows you to look at man's best friend whenever you want,
  and if you are ever in a bad mood, all you need to do is search a picture of a cute fluffy animal.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

  I learned how to call images from multiple different API's and use them together in one singluar image
  app. This was very exciting, because I had never used two diifferent external API's on the same project before,
  and discovering how to do so was very challenging.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

  If I could go over and start the project from scratch, I would create an app which allows
  you to look at specific pictures of certain breeds of cats and dogs when you search for them. This was my original plan,
  after the other reversi game which I had already half-coded, but was told I could not do. I wanted to be able to search for specific breeds
  of the animals, but I could not do this because there is only one picture of each breed of animal, so I had to show the pictures the
  each species at a time.
